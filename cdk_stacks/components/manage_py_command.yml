              # This is a script that makes running manage.py inside a virtualenv from
              # cron easier.
              # It does a few things:
              #     1. It wraps commands in `output-on-error` TODO
              #     2. It calls the manage.py with the virtualenv's python
              # It requires manage.py to be at {{ manage_py_location }}
              #
              {{venv_root}}/bin/python {{ manage_py_location }} "$@"
